#Overview of project and goals

In this project, we sought to create an application that allows users to add outfits
to a bear, save those outfits, and reload the outfits when revisiting the website. In
completing this application, we hoped to learn about the following:
- Creating classes and instantiating objects
- Using local storage to save and access data
- Writing concise code and using parameters wherever possible
- Deepen understanding of event bubbling and propagation
